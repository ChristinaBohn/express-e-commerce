# Express E-commerce Backend

## Description

This application functions as the backend for an e-commerce platform. I have configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Since this application isn't deployed, a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality is provided below.

## Technologies Used

    * Javascript
    * Node.js
    * Express.js
    * Sequelize
    * dotenv
    * Insomnia


## What I Learned

My main challenges in building this app were getting the routes formatted correctly, which I used documentation to work through, and using 'Cascade on Delete' to fix an Insomnia error involving parent/child relations.
